# CalendarBot

Discord Event Planner and Calendar Bot

## Demonstration

### Creating a new event

Using a text channel in a Discord server where CalendarBot is enabled, we can register an account and create our first event using the slash command `/create` with arguments for the event's name, start time, and end time.
